# Dungeon Crawler Gameplay Ideas
    Can find weapons, armor and magic tombes to learn runes
    There are layers to the dungeon, each layer have one exit and different staircases down to a new random dungeon. You cannot go up through the original entrance again
    Clank system that spawns enemies using a director similar to left4dead
    Each dungeon layer get's progressively harder, but main challenge is to conserve resources to proceed further down
    Each section has at least 1 random combat from a pool of possible mobs based on enviorement, freeze section as freeze enemies
    Each layer draws a random theme, fire for example, then it draws from the tech theme for example
    Pokemon style resistances and effectivness in a rock paper scissor style
    You can drop loot to flee combat, to distract enemies
    Take contracts to complete achievements, example kill 5 ice demons
    Noice attracts enemies

# Gameplay Loop
    Collect gold and artifcats in dungeon to buy items, upgrades, heaaling etc
    Lower levels have better rewards
    To get to lower levels you need to pay a soul cost on each floor
    Each time you complete a floor the next one becomes more difficult
    There are shrines in the dungeon where you can pay with souls of slain enemies to buy upgrades
        Shrines are found in boss rooms, risk damage to upgrade
        Different Shrines do different things:
            Rune shrine, Upgrade and Buy runes
            Character shrine, upgrade character
            Artifact Shrine, buy and upgrade weapons and artifacts
        Boss Room initialised as an object with a radius, closes doors and locks player in.
            Spawns boss mob when player is x from center
            Spawns Shrine when boss mob is defeated
        
    Game ends when you die, you can buy resurrection tombs to prevent this, but it will be money you could spend on other upgrades instead
        Each resurrection tomb gets more expensive
